GtkSourceSchemer is a color scheme editor for GtkSourceView applications such as Gedit, Anjuta, and Scribes. It is a standalone Python application, not a plugin. It requires gtk+ 3.x.

If you create a new scheme place it in ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-3.0/styles/ and relaunch Gedit or the editor that will be using the theme.
